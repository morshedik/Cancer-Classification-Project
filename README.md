Welcome to my journey into computational biology and machine learning! This project uses bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to classify three cancer types‚Äî**Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)**, **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)**, and **Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD)**‚Äîwith a simple yet powerful machine learning approach. As a recent medical graduate, I‚Äôm blending my clinical knowledge with data science to explore cancer at the molecular level. Let‚Äôs fight cancer with data together! üöÄ

## üåü Project Overview

### **Goal**
Build a machine learning model to classify BRCA, LUAD, and PRAD based on gene expression profiles, laying the groundwork for personalized medicine insights.

### **Why This Matters**
- **Clinical Impact**: Molecular classification can enhance cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies.
- **Learning Journey**: My first machine learning project‚Äîstepping into a new field with enthusiasm!
- **Open Science**: Sharing my process to inspire collaboration and learning.

### **Dataset**
- **Source**: [TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Pan-Cancer%20(PANCAN)) via UCSC Xena.
- **Data**: Batch effects normalized RNA-seq (11,060 samples, 20,531 genes).
- **Focus**: Filtered to BRCA, LUAD, PRAD (2,311 samples after preprocessing).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps

### **Step 1: Learn the Basics** ‚úÖ
- Mastered Python, pandas, and machine learning fundamentals.
- Resources: Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine Learning course, pandas tutorials.

### **Step 2: Get the Data** ‚úÖ
- Loaded RNA-seq data and metadata in Google Colab.
- Merged gene expression with cancer type labels (`primary_disease`).
- Output: 11,060 samples across 33 cancer types.

### **Step 3: Explore and Preprocess** ‚úÖ *Completed*
- **Filtering**: Narrowed to BRCA, LUAD, PRAD.
- **Cleaning**: Removed 33 PRAD samples with 1,443 missing gene values.
- **Feature Selection**: Selected top 100 most variable genes.
- **Splitting**: 80% training (1,848 samples), 20% testing (463 samples).
- **Next**: Train the model in Step 4!

### **Step 4: Build and Train Model** ‚úÖ
- Trained a logistic regression model on preprocessed TCGA data using the top 100 most variable genes, achieving 100% accuracy on test data. This likely reflects strong biological signals (e.g., KLK3, SFTPB), but potential overfitting was evaluated with cross-validation, feature reduction, and regularization. Model and preprocessed data saved to Google Drive for Step 5 validation.

### **Step 5: Evaluate and Improve** ‚è≥
- Assess accuracy and explore gene importance.

## üìä Current Progress

### **Preprocessed Data Snapshot**
- **Initial Shape**: (11,060, 20,533) ‚Äì 11,060 samples, 20,531 genes + metadata.
- **Filtered Shape**: (2,344, 20,535) ‚Äì After selecting BRCA, LUAD, PRAD.
- **Cleaned Shape**: (2,311, 20,535) ‚Äì After removing 33 PRAD samples.
- **Preprocessed Shape**: (2,311, 102) ‚Äì 100 genes + `sample` + `primary_disease`.
- **Training Set**: (1,848, 100) ‚Äì 80% of samples.
- **Testing Set**: (463, 100) ‚Äì 20% of samples.

### **Sample Counts (After Cleaning)**
- **BRCA**: 1,218
- **LUAD**: 576
- **PRAD**: 517 (originally 550, reduced by 33)

### **Top 5 Most Variable Genes**
| Gene    | Variance  |
|---------|-----------|
| KLK3    | 54.47     |
| SFTPB   | 46.26     |
| KLK2    | 42.90     |
| SCGB2A2 | 35.46     |
| SFTPA1  | 34.84     |

### **Model Training Results**
- Accuracy: Achieved 100% accuracy on both training and test sets, evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation (average 1.00 ¬± 0.00). This suggests perfect separation, likely driven by genes like KLK3 (high in PRAD) and SFTPB (high in LUAD).
- Overfitting Checks: Conducted feature reduction (50 and 30 genes), scaling, regularization (C=0.01), and PCA (50 components), all maintaining 100% accuracy, indicating biological separability rather than overfitting. No sample or patient ID overlap found.

### **Preprocessed Data Example**
```plaintext
   sample           primary_disease           KLK3   SFTPB  KLK2  SCGB2A2  SFTPA1
   TCGA-2A-A8VL-01  prostate adenocarcinoma  19.16  1.02   17.69  0.00     1.84
   TCGA-2A-A8VO-01  prostate adenocarcinoma  19.26  0.74   18.02  0.00     5.15
   TCGA-2A-A8VT-01  prostate adenocarcinoma  16.86  0.80   16.22  0.00     0.80
```

### **Code Snippet**

```python
# Cleaning and Feature Selection
cleaned_data = filtered_data.dropna(subset=gene_cols)
top_genes = X.var().nlargest(100).index
X_selected = X[top_genes]
preprocessed_data = pd.concat([cleaned_data[['sample', 'primary_disease']], X_selected], axis=1)
```
