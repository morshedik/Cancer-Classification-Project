# Cancer-Classification-Project
my first ML project-TCGA_BulkRNAseq
use bulk RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to classify tumors into different cancer types (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, etc.). train a machine learning model to predict the cancer type based on gene expression levels. This is a classic supervised learning task.
